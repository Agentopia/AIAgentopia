  "long_description": "### Overview\nThe Data Insights Team is a multi-agent system designed for tackling complex data analysis challenges. It comprises several specialized agents, each contributing unique skills (e.g., data cleaning, statistical modeling, visualization, natural language reporting). Together, they provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of your data than a single agent might achieve. This team is ideal for organizations looking to extract actionable intelligence from large or multifaceted datasets.\n\n### Key Features:\n*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Agents coordinate tasks and share intermediate results.\n*   **Specialized Roles:** Includes agents for data ingestion, preprocessing, advanced analytics, visualization, and insight communication.\n*   **Scalable Analysis:** Capable of handling larger and more complex datasets by distributing workloads.\n*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates integrated reports combining statistical findings, visualizations, and narrative explanations.\n*   **Customizable Team Composition (Future):** Adapt the team's skills by adding or configuring individual agents.",
