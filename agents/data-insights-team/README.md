# Data Insights Team

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Category:** Data Analysis & Research
**Maintainer:** Agentopia Core Team

---

## Overview

The Data Insights Team is a coordinated team of specialized AI agents that collaboratively analyze complex datasets, generate insights, and produce comprehensive visual reports.

This multi-agent system is designed for tackling complex data analysis challenges. It comprises several specialized agents, each contributing unique skills (e.g., data cleaning, statistical modeling, visualization, natural language reporting). Together, they provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of your data than a single agent might achieve. This team is ideal for organizations looking to extract actionable intelligence from large or multifaceted datasets.

## Features

*   Collaborative analysis by a team of specialized AI agents.
*   Advanced statistical modeling and machine learning capabilities.
*   Generation of interactive dashboards and detailed reports.
*   Natural language explanations of complex findings.
*   Specialized Roles: Includes agents for data ingestion, preprocessing, advanced analytics, visualization, and insight communication.
*   Scalable Analysis: Capable of handling larger and more complex datasets by distributing workloads.
*   Comprehensive Reporting: Generates integrated reports combining statistical findings, visualizations, and narrative explanations.

## Tech Stack

*   **Core Framework:** Python, Agent Communication Framework (e.g., gRPC, REST)
*   **Primary Language:** Python 3.8+
*   **Key Libraries/Dependencies:** pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
*   **LLM(s) Used:** Multiple - Individual agents within the team may have their own LLM dependencies for tasks like natural language processing or report generation. Refer to individual agent manifests for details.
*   **Vector Store (if any):** Not applicable for the coordinating team.
*   **Database (if any):** Not applicable for the coordinating team; depends on data sources.

```
*(Note: The internal structure of `agent_modules/` will vary based on individual agent design.)*

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+ installed.
*   Potentially Docker for managing individual agent services (details TBD).
*   Access to necessary LLMs if required by individual agents in the team.

## Setup & Installation

**Note:** The setup for this multi-agent team is currently in the planning phase ("Actual setup TBD" as per `agent.json`). The following steps are a general guideline and may change.

### 1. Clone the Repository (if not already done)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agentopia/AIAgentopia.git
cd AIAgentopia/agents/data-insights-team
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (for the coordinator)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (for the coordinator)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your details if the coordinator or any core component requires them. Individual agents within the team might have their own `.env` files or configuration methods.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with any necessary API keys or configurations for the coordinator.

### 5. Setup Individual Agents
*   The setup for each specialized agent within the team will need to be performed according to their respective READMEs or documentation. This might involve separate Docker containers or Python processes. (Details TBD)

## Usage

**Note:** Usage instructions are preliminary as the system is in planning.

After setting up the coordinator and all necessary individual agents:

```bash
python coordinator.py --config /path/to/project_config.json
```
(Replace `/path/to/project_config.json` with the actual path to your project's configuration file, which would define data sources, analysis goals, and potentially the configuration for the agent team.)

## Configuration

The Data Insights Team coordinator is configured via command-line arguments and potentially a main configuration file. Individual agents within the team will have their own configuration mechanisms.

**Coordinator Configuration (from `agent.json`):**

*   **`DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG` (CLI: likely via the main `--config` file):**
    *   Label: Data Source Configuration (JSON or Path)
    *   Type: textarea (content expected in JSON or path to a YAML/JSON file)
    *   Required: true
    *   Placeholder: `e.g., {"type": "database", "connection_string": "..."} or /path/to/data_config.yaml`
*   **`ANALYSIS_GOALS` (CLI: likely via the main `--config` file or direct arguments):**
    *   Label: Primary Analysis Goals/Questions (Comma-separated)
    *   Type: text
    *   Required: true
    *   Placeholder: `e.g., Identify sales trends, Predict customer churn`

## How It Works

The Data Insights Team operates as a multi-agent system:
1.  The `coordinator.py` orchestrates the workflow.
2.  It ingests data source configurations and analysis goals.
3.  Tasks are distributed to specialized agents (e.g., data cleaning, statistical modeling, visualization, reporting).
4.  Agents collaborate, potentially sharing intermediate results.
5.  The team collectively generates comprehensive reports and insights.

## Demo

A live demo is not currently available as this agent team is in the planning and development phase.

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```
(Note: Ensure tests are available and configured for the agent team coordinator and individual agents.)

### Linting and Formatting

To check for linting issues and apply auto-fixes (for Python components):
```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

To format the codebase (for Python components):
```bash
ruff format .
```

### Contribution Guidelines

Please refer to the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) in the root of the AIAgentopia repository for general contribution guidelines. For contributions to this agent team:
*   Ensure changes align with the multi-agent architecture.
*   Update documentation for the coordinator and any affected individual agents.
*   Add tests for new features or bug fixes.
*   Update the `agent.json` manifest for the team if overall capabilities change.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Issue:** `[Common issue for multi-agent systems, e.g., inter-agent communication failure]`
    *   **Solution:** `[Check logs of individual agents and coordinator, verify network configuration if applicable]`
*   **Issue:** `[Configuration error for data sources]`
    *   **Solution:** `[Validate the format of DATA_SOURCE_CONFIG against expected schema]`

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

*   User interface for defining analysis projects and team configurations.
*   Real-time collaboration monitoring.
*   Integration with data warehousing solutions.
*   Automated insight discovery and hypothesis generation.
