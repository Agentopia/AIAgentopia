# Data Analyzer Bot - Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy and key test cases for the Data Analyzer Bot to ensure its functionality, reliability, and quality.

## Testing Objectives

*   Verify that all core features listed in the PRD function as expected.
*   Ensure the agent handles various inputs and edge cases gracefully.
*   Confirm the reliability and correctness of the generated output.
*   Validate the user interface and interaction flow.

## Testing Scope

*   **Unit Testing:** (Future goal) To test individual functions and modules in isolation.
*   **Integration Testing:** To test the interaction between different components (e.g., data processing and visualization).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** To test the complete application flow from user input to final output.

## Key Test Cases

The following test cases are derived from the features defined in the `PRD.md`.

| Feature Tested           | Test Case Description                                                              | Expected Result                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File Upload**          | Upload a valid `.csv` file.                                                        | The file is successfully parsed, and the application proceeds to the analysis tabs. |
| **File Upload**          | Upload a valid `.xlsx` file.                                                       | The file is successfully parsed.                                                   |
| **File Upload**          | Upload an unsupported file type (e.g., `.txt`, `.docx`).                           | An appropriate error message is displayed to the user.                             |
| **File Upload**          | Upload a corrupted or malformed CSV/Excel file.                                    | The application handles the error gracefully and shows a relevant message.         |
| **Automated Analysis**   | Run analysis on a dataset with missing values.                                     | The "Missing Value Analysis" table correctly identifies the missing data.          |
| **Automated Analysis**   | Run analysis on a dataset with no missing values.                                  | The section indicates that no missing values were found.                           |
| **Visualizations**       | Generate visualizations for a dataset with both numerical and categorical columns. | Histograms, bar charts, and a heatmap are correctly generated and displayed.       |
| **Visualizations**       | Generate visualizations for a dataset with only numerical columns.                 | Histograms and a heatmap are generated; the bar chart section indicates no categorical data. |
| **AI Summary**           | Run the AI summary with a valid OpenAI API key.                                    | A coherent, natural-language summary is generated and displayed.                   |
| **AI Summary**           | Run the AI summary with a valid Anthropic API key.                                 | A coherent, natural-language summary is generated and displayed.                   |
| **AI Summary**           | Attempt to run the AI summary without providing an API key.                        | A clear warning message is shown, prompting the user to enter a key.               |
| **Report Generation**    | Generate a full HTML report with all sections included.                            | A self-contained `report.html` is generated and can be downloaded.                 |
| **Report Generation**    | Generate a report with only the 'Visualizations' section selected.                 | The downloaded report contains only the visualization images and titles.           |
