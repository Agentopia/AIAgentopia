# AI Music Agent - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Development
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-18

---

## 1. Overview & Introduction

*   **Product Name:** AI Music Agent
*   **One-Liner:** An AI-powered agent that generates custom music tracks from natural language prompts using advanced AI models, with local-first privacy controls.
*   **Problem Statement:** Musicians, content creators, and hobbyists often need custom music tracks but lack the technical skills or resources to create them. Existing solutions are either expensive, require musical expertise, or compromise user privacy. This agent democratizes music creation by enabling anyone to generate high-quality, custom music through simple text descriptions while maintaining complete control over their data and API credentials.
*   **Target Audience:**
    *   Content Creators (YouTube, TikTok, podcasters)
    *   Musicians and Music Producers (for inspiration and prototyping)
    *   Game Developers and App Developers (for background music)
    *   Hobbyists and Music Enthusiasts
    *   Small Businesses (for marketing content)
    *   Educators (for educational content)

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide an accessible, privacy-first music generation tool that enables users to create custom music tracks through natural language prompts, supporting both cloud-based and local-first workflows.
*   **Key Success Metrics:**
    *   **Adoption Rate:** Number of downloads/pulls of the Docker image or clones of the agent code.
    *   **Generation Success Rate:** Percentage of music generation requests completed successfully.
    *   **User Satisfaction:** Quality feedback on generated music tracks and user experience.
    *   **Privacy Compliance:** Zero data leakage incidents and user-controlled credential management.
    *   **Community Engagement:** Number of community contributions, feature requests, and shared music examples.

## 3. Features & Scope

### 3.1. Core Features (MVP)

*   **Feature 1: Text-to-Music Generation**
    *   **Description:** Users input detailed text prompts describing desired music characteristics (genre, instruments, mood, tempo, structure), and the agent generates corresponding MP3 audio files.
    *   **User Story:** As a Content Creator, I want to describe the music I need in plain English so that I can get custom background music for my videos without hiring a composer.

*   **Feature 2: Real-time Audio Playback**
    *   **Description:** Generated music plays immediately in the web interface, allowing users to preview tracks before downloading.
    *   **User Story:** As a User, I want to listen to generated music instantly so that I can decide if it meets my needs before saving it.

*   **Feature 3: MP3 Download & Local Storage**
    *   **Description:** All generated music is saved locally as MP3 files with unique identifiers, and users can download tracks directly from the interface.
    *   **User Story:** As a Game Developer, I want to download generated music files so that I can integrate them into my projects.

*   **Feature 4: Secure API Key Management**
    *   **Description:** API keys are managed through local `.env` files with automatic loading when available, falling back to sidebar input fields. Keys are never committed to version control and remain under user control.
    *   **User Story:** As a Privacy-Conscious User, I want to use my own API keys through secure local configuration so that I maintain control over my data and costs without repeatedly entering credentials.

*   **Feature 5: Enhanced Prompt Engineering**
    *   **Description:** The agent uses GPT-4 to enhance user prompts with detailed musical elements, improving generation quality and consistency.
    *   **User Story:** As a Non-Musician, I want the agent to understand my basic descriptions and create detailed musical specifications so that I get better results.

*   **Feature 6: Comprehensive Error Handling**
    *   **Description:** Robust error handling for API failures, network issues, and invalid responses, with clear user feedback and debugging information.
    *   **User Story:** As a User, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

### 3.2. Enhanced Features (Post-MVP)

*   **Feature 7: Local LLM Support (Ollama Integration)**
    *   **Description:** Support for local LLM models via Ollama, reducing dependency on external APIs and improving privacy.
    *   **User Story:** As a Privacy-First User, I want to use local AI models so that my prompts never leave my machine.

*   **Feature 8: Batch Music Generation**
    *   **Description:** Generate multiple music tracks from a list of prompts or variations of a single prompt.
    *   **User Story:** As a Content Creator, I want to generate multiple music variations so that I can choose the best one for my project.

*   **Feature 9: Music Style Templates**
    *   **Description:** Pre-defined prompt templates for common music styles and use cases (e.g., "Upbeat Podcast Intro", "Relaxing Background Music").
    *   **User Story:** As a Beginner, I want ready-made templates so that I can generate good music without knowing how to describe musical elements.

*   **Feature 10: Advanced Audio Controls**
    *   **Description:** User controls for music length, quality settings, and output format options.
    *   **User Story:** As a Professional User, I want to control technical aspects of generation so that I can get exactly what I need for my projects.

### 3.3. Out of Scope (for this version)

*   Real-time music editing or post-processing capabilities.
*   Support for audio formats other than MP3 (initially).
*   Integration with external music platforms or streaming services.
*   Advanced music theory analysis or composition tools.
*   Collaborative features or multi-user support.
*   Commercial licensing or rights management.

## 4. User Flow & Interaction Model

*   **Interaction Type:** Web-based Streamlit application following Agentopia UI/UX guidelines, run locally or via Docker container.
*   **UI/UX Standards:** Implements standard Agentopia branding with sidebar header, agent-specific title panel, and consistent styling using the `ui_components.py` template.
*   **High-Level User Flow:**
    1.  User launches the AI Music Agent (locally via Python or Docker container).
    2.  User accesses the web interface at `http://localhost:8501` with standard Agentopia branding.
    3.  User configures API keys either via `.env` file or sidebar input fields.
    4.  User enters a music prompt describing desired characteristics.
    5.  Agent enhances the prompt using GPT-4 and generates music via ModelsLab API.
    6.  User previews generated music in the browser and downloads MP3 files locally.
    7.  Generated music files are stored locally with UUID-based naming for organization.

*   **Deployment Options:**
    *   **Docker (Recommended):** Single command deployment with `docker run -d --name ai-music-agent -p 8501:8501 agentopia/ai-music-agent:latest`
    *   **Local Python:** Traditional installation with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `streamlit run app/music_generator.py`
    *   **Container Features:** Non-root user security, health checks, optimized build context, comprehensive documentation

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   **Key Dependencies:** Python 3.8+, Streamlit, Agno framework, OpenAI API, ModelsLab API, Requests library.
*   **Architecture:** Single-agent design using the Agno framework for orchestration between GPT-4 (prompt enhancement) and ModelsLab (music generation).
*   **Data Handling:** All processing occurs locally. User prompts are sent to APIs only for generation. Generated music files are stored locally with UUID-based naming.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   **OpenAI GPT-4o:** Used for prompt enhancement and musical instruction generation.
    *   **ModelsLab API:** Used for actual music generation from enhanced prompts.
    *   **User-Controlled:** All API keys provided by users, ensuring cost and privacy control.
*   **Security & Privacy:**
    *   API keys managed via local `.env` files with `.env.example` template provided.
    *   Fallback to session-based input fields when `.env` not available.
    *   Generated music files remain on user's local machine.
    *   No user data transmitted beyond necessary API calls.
    *   `.env` files excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
*   **Error Handling:** Comprehensive validation for API responses, network connectivity, file downloads, and content type verification.

## 6. Agentopia Integration Requirements
