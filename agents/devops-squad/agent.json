  "long_description": "### Overview\nThe DevOps Squad is a multi-agent system designed to streamline and automate the complexities of modern software development and operations. It includes specialized agents for tasks like code linting, automated testing, build management, deployment orchestration, infrastructure provisioning (IaC), and performance monitoring. This squad aims to improve development velocity, reduce manual errors, and ensure robust and scalable application delivery.\n\n### Key Features:\n*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.\n*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Management:** Agents can interact with tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.\n*   **Automated Testing & Quality Assurance:** Integrates with testing frameworks to run various test suites.\n*   **Performance Monitoring & Alerting:** Observes application performance and system health, triggering alerts or corrective actions.\n*   **Security Scanning & Compliance (Future):** Incorporate agents for vulnerability scanning and compliance checks.",
