# Layered Architecture for AIAgentopia

**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-06

---

## Background & Intent

AIAgentopia aims to provide a robust, extensible, and privacy-respecting platform for developing, running, and sharing AI agents. Our approach is to build the repository over time using a clear, modular, and layered architecture. This ensures:
- Each agent is isolated and easy to maintain
- The system is extensible for future frameworks/tools
- Users can choose between local and cloud LLMs (e.g., via Ollama or API)
- Contributors can easily understand and extend the platform

This document outlines the foundational layered architecture that guides our design and development.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      User Interface & Documentation Layer                   |
|  (README, guides, CLI, example notebooks, user docs)        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Integration & Synchronization Layer                    |
|  (Portal sync scripts, APIs, deployment utilities)           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Agent Implementation Layer                             |
|  (Each agent in its own directory/environment)               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Framework/Agentic Layer                                |
|  (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, agent base classes, plugins)   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Core Infrastructure Layer                              |
|  (LLM interface, config, logging, manifest validation, I/O)  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Foundational Layer (System & Environment)              |
|  (Docker, venv, OS-level setup, dependency managers)         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Layer Descriptions

1. **Foundational Layer (System & Environment)**
   - Docker, Python venv, OS-level setup, dependency managers
   - Provides runtime isolation and environment management

2. **Core Infrastructure Layer**
   - Shared utilities: LLM interfaces, config, logging, manifest validation, I/O
   - Ensures consistency and reusability across agents

3. **Framework/Agentic Layer**
   - Agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.)
   - Base classes and plugin interfaces for agent logic

4. **Agent Implementation Layer**
   - Each agent in its own folder/environment
   - Implements specific tasks and logic

5. **Integration & Synchronization Layer**
   - Scripts/utilities for syncing with the portal, APIs, deployments
   - Handles cross-agent and external system integration

6. **User Interface & Documentation Layer**
   - User and developer documentation, guides, CLI, example notebooks
   - Ensures ease of use and onboarding
