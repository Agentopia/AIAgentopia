# ðŸš€ AI Agent Optimization Checklist

Use this checklist once an agent has been developed and conforms to the standard directory structure. This phase focuses on enhancing performance, security, and maintainability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimization

### Code Optimization
- [ ] Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize database queries and data access patterns
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate (Redis, in-memory, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize LLM prompt engineering
- [ ] Implement request batching where applicable
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and garbage collection

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Review and optimize container resources (CPU/memory limits)
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling rules if applicable
- [ ] Implement health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure appropriate timeouts and retries

## ðŸ”’ Security Enhancements

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Validate all input data
- [ ] Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use TLS for data in transit
- [ ] Implement proper secret management
- [ ] Review and minimize data collection
- [ ] Implement data retention policies

### Dependencies
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Scan for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Pin dependency versions
