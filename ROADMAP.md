## Phase Status
- [x] Phase 1: Foundational & Core Infrastructure (In Progress)
- [ ] Phase 2: Frameworks & Agent Implementation (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 3: Integration & Synchronization (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 4: User Interface & Documentation (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 5: Community & Advanced Features (Not Started)

_Update this section as each phase is started or completed._

## Vision
AIAgentopia is committed to building a modular, privacy-first, and extensible platform for AI agents. Our layered architecture (see [`docs/layered-architecture.md`](./docs/layered-architecture.md)) guides our development to maximize clarity, maintainability, and future growth.

## Roadmap by Layer & Phase

### Phase 1: Foundational & Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Establish foundational environment setup (Docker, venv, dependency management)
- [ ] Create and document the layered architecture ([`docs/layered-architecture.md`](./docs/layered-architecture.md))
- [ ] Implement core infrastructure utilities:
  - [ ] LLM interface (API & local/Ollama)
  - [ ] Config management
  - [ ] Logging and error handling
  - [ ] Manifest schema and validation tools

### Phase 2: Frameworks & Agent Implementation

- [ ] **Strategic Agent Planning**
  - [ ] Identify and prioritize the first set of AI agents to build, focusing on both personal/professional utility and portal showcase value.
  - [ ] Select and assign agentic frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) so at least one agent is built with each.
  - [ ] Ensure coverage of all agent Types (Assistant, Autonomous, Hybrid), Scales (Simple, Intermediate, Advanced, Complex), and Categories (Data Analysis & Research, Productivity & Organization, Automation & Utilities, Creative Content & Design).
  - [ ] Maintain a planning table (see below) to track framework, type, scale, and category coverage.

#### Agent Planning Table Example

| Agent Name         | Framework   | Type       | Scale        | Category                     | Status   |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------|----------|
| Data Analyzer Bot  | LangChain   | Assistant  | Intermediate | Data Analysis & Research     | Planned  |
| Task Organizer     | CrewAI      | Autonomous | Simple       | Productivity & Organization  | Planned  |
| Automation Helper  | AutoGen     | Hybrid     | Advanced     | Automation & Utilities       | Planned  |
| Creative Writer    | LangChain   | Assistant  | Simple       | Creative Content & Design    | Planned  |
| ...                | ...         | ...        | ...          | ...                          | ...      |

- [ ] Scaffold and implement the prioritized agents per the planning table.
- [ ] Add requirements, Dockerfile, and documentation for each agent.
- [ ] Enable agent isolation (each in its own directory/environment).

### Phase 3: Integration & Synchronization
- [ ] Build and document portal sync scripts (integration with Agentopia portal)
- [ ] Develop deployment utilities and APIs for agent management
- [ ] Ensure robust cross-agent and external system integration

### Phase 4: User Interface & Documentation
- [ ] Expand user-facing documentation ([`docs/`](./docs/))
- [ ] Add usage guides, CLI tools, and example notebooks
- [ ] Implement contribution guidelines and onboarding materials

### Phase 5: Community & Advanced Features
- [ ] Open for community agent submissions
- [ ] Add advanced orchestration (multi-agent workflows, plugins)
- [ ] Implement user feedback, rating, and sharing features
- [ ] Continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving needs

## How to Track Progress
- Use GitHub Issues for all features, bugs, and tasks
- Group Issues into Milestones (matching roadmap phases)
- Use GitHub Projects (Kanban board) for real-time progress tracking
- Regularly update this ROADMAP and check off completed items
