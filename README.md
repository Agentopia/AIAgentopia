## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Please open an issue or submit a pull request. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be added) for guidelines.

## Development & Contribution

- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.
- All agents must include an `agent.json` manifest following the [agent-manifest.schema.json](./agent-manifest.schema.json).

### Agent Manifest Validation (Gatekeeper Script)

To ensure all agents are valid and compatible with the Agentopia portal, run the validation script before submitting changes:

1. **Install dependencies** (only needed once):
   ```sh
   npm install ajv
   ```
2. **Run the validation script:**
   ```sh
   node tools/validate-agents.js
   ```

- The script will scan all `agent.json` files in `agents/` and check them against the schema.
- If any manifest is invalid, the script will print errors and exit with a non-zero code (good for CI/CD too).
- Fix any errors before submitting your PR!
