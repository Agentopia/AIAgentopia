AIAgentopia is your all-in-one hub for building, experimenting with, and showcasing AI agents. Our mission is to make AIAgentopia a welcoming and productive environment for creating AI agents, supporting a wide variety of frameworks, tools, and approaches.

## 1. What is Agentopia?
*   Agentopia empowers developers and users with AI agents that primarily run **local-first**, ensuring user data privacy and control over credentials.
*   This `AIAgentopia` repository hosts the core development framework, agent development standards, a collection of reference AI agents, and essential tools.
*   We aim to foster a vibrant community around creating and sharing innovative AI agents.
*   > For a deeper dive into our vision, goals, and long-term plan, please see our [Agentopia Vision & Plan](docs/agentopia-vision-plan.md).

## 2. Guiding Principles & Architecture
*   **Architectural Philosophy:** We are committed to a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture to support a diverse ecosystem of agents.
    *   > Learn more about our [Layered Architecture](docs/layered-architecture.md).
*   **Repository Structure:**
    *   `/agents`: Contains individual, self-contained AI agents. Each agent resides in its own subdirectory.
    *   `/docs`: Project-level documentation, development standards, architectural guides, and other key resources.
    *   `/templates/agent-docs`: Standardized Markdown templates for agent documentation (e.g., READMEs, PRDs).
    *   `/tools`: Scripts and utilities for development, validation, and other operational tasks.
    *   > For a complete breakdown of the repository layout and rationale, refer to the [Directory Structure Guide](docs/directory-structure.md).

## 3. Technical Foundations & Standards
*   A consistent and high-quality development experience is key. Our technical foundations include:
    *   **Agent Manifest (`agent.json`):** Each agent describes itself using a standardized `agent.json` manifest file. This enables discovery, configuration, and integration with the Agentopia portal.
        *   > See the [Manifest Schema Guide](docs/manifest-schema-guide.md) for detailed specifications.
    *   **Development Frameworks:** Agentopia supports flexibility in choosing backend frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) on a per-agent basis.
        *   > Read our [Agent Framework Considerations](docs/agent-framework-consideration.md) for guidance.
    *   **Technology Stack:** We provide guidelines for technology choices, especially encouraging consistency for frontend/UX aspects of agent demos where applicable.
        *   > Consult the [Preferred Tech Stack Guidelines](docs/preferred-tech-stack-guidelines.md).
    *   **Core Development Standards:** A comprehensive set of standards governs all aspects of agent development within Agentopia.
        *   > **All agent developers MUST adhere to the [Agent Development Standards](docs/agent-development-standards.md).**

## 4. Project Roadmap & Status
*   Agentopia is under active development, following a phased approach outlined in our project roadmap.
*   The roadmap details current priorities, upcoming features, planned agents, and also serves as our primary project status tracker.
*   > View the [Project Roadmap & Current Status](ROADMAP.md).

## 5. Development & Contribution
*   We warmly welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're interested in developing a new agent, improving documentation, or enhancing our tools, our [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide is your primary resource.
*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md` covers:**
    *   Our general development workflow, issue tracking (Milestones, Epics, Issues), and pull request process.
    *   The Code of Conduct.
    *   **A comprehensive "Agent Developer Guide" section**: This walks you through the entire lifecycle of creating and integrating a new AI agent, from initial concept to submission. It links to all necessary standards, templates, and tools.
    *   Guidance on adhering to our [Agent Development Standards](docs/agent-development-standards.md).
    *   Information on pre-commit hooks and linting.
