## Prerequisites

*   `[e.g., Python 3.10 or higher]`
*   `[e.g., Docker (if applicable)]`
*   `[e.g., Access to OpenAI API or other LLM provider]`
*   `[List any other system-level dependencies or accounts needed. Align with requirements in agent.json]`

## Setup & Installation

`[Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the agent for local development and execution. This should align with setup_instructions in agent.json.]`

### 1. Clone the Repository (if not already done)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agentopia/AIAgentopia.git
cd AIAgentopia/agents/[agent-name]
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your details:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit `.env` with your specific API keys, configurations, etc.

**Required Environment Variables:**
*   `[VARIABLE_NAME_1]`: `[Description of what it's for]`
*   `[VARIABLE_NAME_2]`: `[Description of what it's for]`

<!-- List all critical environment variables. -->

## Usage

`[Explain how to run or interact with the agent. Provide command-line examples or steps to access its UI.]`

### Running the Agent (Example for a CLI tool)

```bash
python app/main.py [arguments or options]
```

### Accessing the Agent (Example for a web service/demo)

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py  # Or your specific command
```

Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:[port]`.

## Configuration

`[Detail any important configuration options available to the user, beyond environment variables. This could include configuration files, command-line arguments, or settings within the agent's UI. Align with configFields in agent.json.]`

*   **Option 1 (`config_key_1`):** `[Description, possible values, default value]`
*   **Option 2 (`config_key_2`):** `[Description, possible values, default value]`

## How It Works

`[Optional: Provide a brief explanation of the agent's architecture or core logic. This can link to a more detailed architecture.md in the agent's /docs directory.]`

## Demo

`[Link to a live demo if available, or provide instructions on how to run a local demo. Screenshots or GIFs can be very helpful here.]`

<!-- Example:
To run the demo locally:
```bash
streamlit run app/demo.py
```
-->

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```
