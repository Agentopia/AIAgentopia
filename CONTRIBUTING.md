## üß© How to Add a New Agent

1. **Create a New Agent Folder**
   - In the `agents/` directory, create a folder for your agent (e.g., `agents/my-awesome-agent`).

2. **Add an `agent.json` Manifest**
   - Every agent must include an `agent.json` file that follows our [Agent Manifest Schema](./agent-manifest.schema.json).
   - See the schema file for required and optional fields.
   - Example manifest is provided in the schema and below.

3. **Validate Your Manifest**
   - Use [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or a similar tool.
   - Paste your `agent.json` and the [schema file](./agent-manifest.schema.json) to check for errors.

4. **Add Your Agent Code**
   - Include the main entry point file (e.g., `main.py`) and any supporting files in your agent‚Äôs folder.

5. **Test Your Agent**
   - Run the sync script in the portal repo to ensure your agent appears in the Agentopia portal.
   - Check that all required fields display correctly and setup instructions are clear.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
